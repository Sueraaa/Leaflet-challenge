# Leaflet-challenge
## IntIntroduction:
This interactive map visualizes earthquake data using leaflet.js and GeoJSON. It displays earthquake locations as circle markers on the map, with marker sizes and colors indicating the magnitude and depth of each earthquake, respectively. Additionally, a legend provides context for interpreting the markers. Users can interact with the map to explore earthquake distribution and characteristics, enhancing their understanding  activities in the selected region.
